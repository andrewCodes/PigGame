### THE PIG GAME

## GAME RULES

The Pig Game is a dice rolling game for two players. First to 100 points win. 

You can roll the dice as many times as you like, accumulating score as you go. However, if you roll a 1 you lose all the points you have accumulated and the dice passes to the other player. You can save your score at any time by "holding" your score. This held score cannot be lost. When you hold, the dice passes to the other player who then has their go.


## ABOUT

The game is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are no dependencies. Simply download the code and open the index file in your browser to play.

As this is a two player game it has been designed to be played on desktop.

The JavaScript file is heavily commented and I have included a flowchart to help explain the game logic.
